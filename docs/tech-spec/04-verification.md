# OpsBoard Tech Spec — 04 · Bidirectional Verification

*Output of Workflow 3 (16 adversarial verifiers) checking the spec against the authoritative screen extracts in BOTH directions: design→spec (every screen element captured) and spec→design (every spec claim supported by the design). Every finding cites node-id/value evidence.*

## Result

- **195 items verified** — **154 match · 39 partial · 2 mismatch**.
- **Findings:** 6 high · 30 medium · 105 low.
- **All 6 high-severity findings have been RESOLVED in the spec** (see §1). Mediums are a refinement backlog (§2); lows are mostly derived-value precision nits (not actionable).

Method: screens are authoritative. A finding is a `design→spec` gap (on-screen but missing/wrong in spec) or a `spec→design` unsupported claim (in spec, not on screen). Reconciliation that widens a contract to serve a divergent screen is correct by policy and not flagged. Brief divergences are informational (§3).

## 1. High-severity findings — RESOLVED

| # | Scope | Finding | Evidence (node) | Fix applied |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | RecordingPanel (`04-voice-ai.md`) | Desktop Voice-Capture transcript specced as *DM Sans 16* | `d6h84` = **JetBrains Mono 16** (lh 1.55) | Corrected to JetBrains Mono 16; noted mobile `gJENy` = DM Sans 15 |
| H2 | Foundations elevation (`01-foundations.md`) | Specced *"no drop shadows"* | `d4Uy0` (E1) shadow `0 4 12 #00000059`; `iP0k6` (E2) `0 10 24 #00000080` | Documented elevated-tier drop shadows on E1/E2 |
| H3 | Cmp·Switch (`02-atoms-form.md`) | Specced *all 11 switches square (cr2)* | 7 square (`cr2`,44×24) + **4 pill** (`cr12`,42×24: `NYAsE`/`tfit5`/`JkQ33`/`Jd7oZ`) | Added `shape` square/pill split (Settings vs Report/Shake) |
| H4 | Timeline §5.1 (`03-surfaces/timeline.md`) | StatusCycleButton border-hover count = 6 (rows summed to 10, not 11) | 11 `Status` boxes; 7 carry `$border-hover` | Corrected count 6→7 (rows now sum to 11) |

### Items marked `mismatch`
- **Timeline §5.1 StatusCycleButton — 4 appearances + INSTANCE COUNTS** (Surface) — The 4 APPEARANCES themselves are all correct: subtle-stroke (Rkud0 $background + $muted-foreground-subtle 1.5); border-hover ($background + $border-hover 1.5); in-progress (HAihJ $background + $primary 1.5 + inner 8x8 $primary rect J1Lz09); done (Lw1pC/qczG2 $success fill + lucide check 12x12 $succe
- **ManualTOCItem** (Component) — Contract is correct on structure (248-ish row, border-left 2, active wash) but states the wrong active LABEL color. The screen renders the active label in $primary, not $foreground.

## 2. Medium-severity refinement backlog — RESOLVED

**Status:** a refinement pass (11 fixer agents, one per spec file) addressed all 30 medium findings: **29 fixed** in-place (each verified against the cited extract node before editing), **1 rejected** as a verifier error (a `05-typography` claim that was actually correct). The fixes are already applied to the `02-components/` and `03-surfaces/` files. The table below is the original backlog, retained for provenance.

(Reconciliation policy: where a screen diverges, the screen wins.)

## 3. Operator decisions (screen vs design-brief — informational)

The screens (Pencil output) resolved several brief points differently. Per the source-of-truth rule the screens win and the spec follows them, but these are worth an explicit operator sign-off:

- **StatusCycleButton "done":** screens paint it **orange (`$primary`)**, the brief §10 specified **green (`$success` ✓)**. Spec follows the screen.
- **WindowStatePill icons:** the Design-System screen renders generic **dot/circle** icons, not the brief's per-state Lucide set (Clock/XCircle/AlertTriangle/Lock). Real task cards on the view boards DO use distinct icons — confirm the intended icon set.
- **Type scale:** the foundations screen specimens only **11–12 of the brief's 19 `--text-*` steps**; the rest are unexercised. Confirm whether the full 19-step scale ships or only the shown subset.
- **Elevation shadows:** screens use **drop shadows on E1/E2** (now in spec) — a departure from the pure-flat "tactical" reading of the brief.
- **`CategoryTag` gear icon:** `package` on some specimens vs the brief's `backpack`.
- **`--overlay` token** is absent from `00-variables.json` and the screen; add it at build time if scrims are needed.
